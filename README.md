This program, implemented in Haskell, is a functional programming exercise to parse text and replace markdown with HTML code.  This takes a markdown file as input, and outputs a formatted html file.   It only accepts a subset of valid markdown syntax.  There may be some slight variations from the official versions of markdown.

My project has a few files included.  `markdown.hs` includes the Haskell source code I wrote.  `input.md` contains the example of all markdown syntax that the program accepts, and `output.html` shows the output generated by the program when it runs on `input.md`.

To compile and run:
```
ghc --make markdown -o markdown
./markdown input.md output.html
```
**Supported Syntax**

Supported syntax includes **bold**, *italics*, `monospaced`, as well as
* Various kinds of lists (ordered and unordered)

and lines.

Any unsupported HTML code or syntax will be sanitized with HTML escape characters such as `&lt;`no additional, unsupported HTML will be created.
